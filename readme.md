response.

Depending on the chosen language, the game loads a list of
corresponding cities from a pre-prepared text file. The `ResourceBundle`
class was used for interface localization.

The task was to create a simple graphical application with
independent study and utilization of the `java.swing` and `java.awt`
libraries.

Additionally, the ability to choose difficulty level was implemented,
which is determined by the time limit for player word input.

The game also saves the top 10 scores in a text file.

This program was developed as an independent project during the GOIT
Java Developer - 14 course, as a culmination of the Java Core
learning stage. It was created by a group of three students (group-7).
